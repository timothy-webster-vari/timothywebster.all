#Books by Tim Webster

<div markdown = "1" id = "books">
Many people who look at my resum√© ask about my writing career. In the very early days of the dot com bubble there was an explosion of books about web development, and I found that writing was a lot more interesting that the neolithic web development I was doing at the time. I wrote this summary of my writing career quite a few years ago, and I still stand by it.

[**SiteMill Book:**](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/156830319X/105-1018279-2064405?SubscriptionId=18KH0TE66DJMX9TMF1R2)
I was playing around with the Web Services API at Amazon and I came
across this book. I completely forgot that I wrote it. In fact, I wasn&apos;t
sure that I did at first, but I have a vague recollection of working on
it at my friends&apos; cottage in Wisconsin. I remember setting up httpd on
one of the old Mac OSs (probably 8.x) because I needed to have a running
web server for something and I was out in the middle of nowhere. Of
course, setting up httpd is easy on a Mac now, and everywhere else, but
it seemed like a bit of an ordeal at the time. It can&apos;t have been too
tight a deadline, because what I really remember about that weekend is
reading *Madame Bovary* and drinking a lot of scotch. Maybe I only did a
chapter or two, but my name ended up on the book. I dunno. I sure don&apos;t
remember anything being released by Adobe Press. Probably this book was
cancelled, and the stuff that I wrote was repurposed. I think that kind
of thing happened a lot back in the 90s.

This book was the high point of my 90s writing career. I was interested
in the topic and knew what I was talking about. I remember the pictures
being a little goofy, but I haven&apos;t seen a copy of this in a while, so I
can&apos;t remember the details.

[**Tcl/Tk for
Dummies:**](http://www.amazon.com/TCL-TK-Dummies-Tim-Webster/dp/0764501526/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1210126556&sr=1-5)
This book was a total disaster. I still feel so bad about it that I don&apos;t use
tcl any more, even though there are tcl tools for websphere.

All of my previous books had been for Macmillan, and I really understood
their system. I had a really good editor at IDG (the Dummies people),
but she had many, many much more important projects on her plate at the
time. I remember writing and writing and writing, and according to the
templates, it was still much shorter than I thought it was. I asked
about several times, and was told every time "no, it&apos;s fine, trust the
templates." I did, and the book turned out to be about 550 pages, which
is 200 pages too long for a Dummies book. IDG is very particular about
stuff like page count, so I had to chop it up completely. Of course,
there is no way to remove 40% of a book without ruining it. And the
chopping process was pretty short--less than a week, probably.

What was even worse, if that is possible, was that there was no
technical editor. I think this is why there were some issues with code
samples. I am still cringing about it ten years later. I had been
working with a couple of nice guys at Sun, whom I assumed would be able
to do a technical review, but when the time came, Sun wouldn&apos;t give them
permission to work on it. No doubt they had a good reason. I couldn&apos;t
find anyone to do it, which tells you how deep my roots in the Tcl/Tk
community really run. I don&apos;t know why IDG didn&apos;t just pull the plug,
but they found somebody&apos;s spouse who had installed Linux at some point
in his life, and he did the technical review. I remember quite clearly
that he didn&apos;t flag anything. Which, of course, would be ludicrous even
if it was a much better book.

Just to make matters worse, writing this book turned out to be the end
of my relationship with my literary agent. I worked with a couple
people, mainly Don Crabbe, who I knew from the University of Chicago.
Sadly Don, who was morbidly obese, dropped over dead one day. Don had
encouraged me to pursue a deal with IDG without any representation (and
I think I actually got a pretty sweet contract), but apparently he never
talked about it with his surviving partner, because the partner was
annoyed that they did not get a piece of the IDG pie. Or something. (I
realize now that if I had had an agent, I might have been able to solve
some of the problems that I have described.) I find that what I remember
most about books is the physical details about writing them, and for
some reason, the bulk of this one was done at the kitchen table. I guess
I needed a change from my regular writing spot, which was a tiny little
sun porch in my Chicago apartment.

**[Dreamweaver
Book:](http://www.amazon.com/Using-Macromedia-Dreamweaver-Rick-Darnell/dp/B00007FYEG/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1210129728&sr=1-11)**
Not a very interesting book, or an interesting topic, but this one stands
out in my memory because it was the end of the road for me. I had
reached a point where I could really grind out pages, so I did. I did
about half of this, at the rate of a chapter a day. I don&apos;t remember if
they were good or bad chapters, only that I know that it was my last
book, I had a big road trip planned, and I was eager to get it done and
get on with the next part of my life. (The road trip turned out to be
the best thing I ever did.)

I quit writing for a lot of reasons. It certainly wasn&apos;t fun any more,
and I felt like quality was totally secondary to timeliness; everyone
wanted the first book on the Next Big Thing, not a good book on a good
thing. I understand that a little now--they are just trying to make
enough to survive, not offer a public service--but my name was attached
to some books that I didn&apos;t think were very good.

Less altruistically, I could tell--anyone could tell--in 1998, that the
jig was up for the books-about-the-internet industry. I would go to
bookstores, just to see what people were writing about, and it seemed
like the market was completely saturated, and it was easier and better
to find the information that you wanted via google. You could always
write books about new products, or new versions of familiar products,
but those books always have super-tight deadlines, and if the product
doesn&apos;t sell, the book doesn&apos;t, either.
