#Study Website
I was having lunch with my lab and some of our collaborators and the people who were organizing a study mentioned that they would be emailing spreadsheets full of data back and forth. It sounded like a nightmare of synchronization that would be solved by a shared spreadsheet. Because tossing a spreadsheet onto a file share somewhere was impractical when the data was shared between two institutions with irreconcilable IT policies, I offered to build a small webapp that allowed the same kind of sharing with better concurrency, transparent version control, etc.

My tool for this task was the [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.org), a Rails-y, Django-y kind of web framework for Java. It does a pretty good job at automagically building web front ends for database tables, and stays out of your way in other places.

This project was a good step for me on the journey to change my thinking about how to create clean interfaces between the middleware and the browser. When you have something that is as tabular in format as a calendar, it's silly to *not* render the markup programatically. I guess I could have done that in the browser rather than in the middleware, but what I would gain in conceptual purity I think I would lose re-encoding the same data in different string formats. I wound up with fairly static and semantically clean HTML and dynamically generated css, which seemed like a step in the right direction. However, if you are sensitive about color, you might not want to give users the ability to specify arbitary colors for tagging their stuff:

<img src = "/assets/go_calendar.png" width = "90%"/>

One interesting thing about Play is that it rewrites the bytecodes of your classes. It's very convenient to be able to replace a lot of the usual boilerplate stuff with annotations, and it allows for something like aspect-oriented programming. Aspects are totally killer for decoupling security from logic: just annotate methods with whatever security tags you devise, write a security checker class, and all of the actual checking is injected for you. But I always felt a little bit like "enhancing" .class files was like fooling around with dangerous proto-matter...there was stuff in there that I could not see by looking at my source code. I think that is probably always true with a reasonably smart compiler or runtime, but at least those enhancements are in a spec that I can easily check if I am feeling daffy.
