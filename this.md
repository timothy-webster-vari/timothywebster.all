#This Site
A long time ago I needed to pick a web content management system for a client, and I picked drupal. I don't think there is a one-size-fits-all CMS that everybody can use for everything, and since the client already had a few php guys on board, it seemed like a pretty good fit. One nice thing about drupal is that it has a big enough user base that you can go to the store and buy a book, or find a consultant on the internet, or whatever.

It turns out there were more people nearby who needed drupal stuff, and I am the kind of agreeable freelancer who goes where the work is. So I built some more drupal sites, and it was handy to keep my own stuff in drupal, since I already knew the configuration stuff.

I am not going to trash talk drupal here, but it really is a lot of infrastructure for features that I was not using. All of my pages are visible to the public, I don't have users who sign in and post their own content, etc. So I thought about what I really wanted to do:

- write content in markdown
- wrap that content up in some kind of template
- create static exports, so that I could build phonegap applications (or offline html5, or whatever)
- some kind of workflow that was as good as git

So, I googled on *markdown, template, export* and *git,* and found [Jeckyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), which is exactly what I thought I would write myself if I were starting from scratch, and there was already a community of very smart folks using it. The Internet is good like that. (I don't think I would have done it in ruby, but that's not a dealbreaker, either.)
